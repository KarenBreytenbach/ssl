Starting from Chrome 56, passwords fields not hosted over HTTPS will show a "insecure" warning. 

This will be less noticeable for 56 at first, but will be a large red error in later versions which will chase users away.

Any pages with a password field are assumed to carry personal information which would need to be secured.

# How do I fix this ?

Enable HTTPS for the entire website or just for the specific pages that require the user to enter a Password.

This will avoid the error on Chrome and show a **SECURE** status on the url bar again.
